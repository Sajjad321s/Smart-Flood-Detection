# Flood-Detection
This system will be specially designed for the people who live in the flood affected areas. This system will detect the water level by a ‘Water Level Sensor’ and this sensor will work as a monitoring device of the water level during flood time. The ‘Ultrasonic Sensor’ will work as a distance monitoring device which will detect the distance of a person from the flood affecting area and it will also be shown in an output device (LCD Display or a buzzer). It will confirm that the person is currently a good distance from the affected area. Last but not least, there will be a water pressure detection system which will be used to measure the flood water pressure and send an output to the output device. It will ensure that, how much the water is creating pressure and how it’s affecting the people in the flood area.
